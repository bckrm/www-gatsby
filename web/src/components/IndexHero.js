                        We collaborated with the Barcoding team to define a
                        brand architecture and positioning that moved them
                        beyond vertical lines and into the lynchpin of supply
                        chain in an ever-changing technological world. An
                        evolution of their existing logo showed a progression
                        away from the barcode, while giving a nod to their
                        original namesake with an elevated wordmark.

                        We partnered with Volo City, a national brand that
                        strengthens communities and impacts economic health
                        through sports leagues. We unified each of their cities
                        and the youth non-profit under a name that was inspired
                        by the style of bocce that was played in their very
                        first league.

                        With a month before go-time, our team designed and
                        launched a co-branded website to support the launch of
                        D.C. Unitedâ€™s new stadium, Audi Field. The site was
                        designed to capture the group energy anticipation of a
                        game day in a digital space, with fly-through videos and
                        a countdown timer to keep fans charged up.
